                            The graph below illustrates all of the similar cases to "<strong>{props.case.caseName}</strong>".
                            On the Y axis, the relevance score is displayed. This ranges from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1</strong>. 0 implies that
                            a case is entirely irrelevant and 1 implies that a case is extremely relevant and may worth consideration.
